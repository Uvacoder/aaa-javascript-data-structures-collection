# JavaScript Data Structures

The first in a number of repos that are reviewing data structures for the languages I use most.

For each of these ones, I am hoping to build a mental model behind the algorithm that is - at least - memorable for myself to at least understand the gist of what occurs for each data structure.

## To practice writing the data structures

Within each directory, there is an accompanying `README.md` that is a copy of notes from my [developer notes](https://github.com/okeeffed/developer-notes) that should give a short intro on the topic, as well as an small accompanying test (doesn't reach out for many cases).

To practise, clean up the accompanying `index.js` file. To run the accompanying test, install the dependencies and run `yarn test path/to/index.test.js`. I recommend to pass the `--watch` flag in order to update tests as you go (be careful in the recursion tests that you don't cause an endless loop).
